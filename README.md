TODO:

- Test if win detection and KI works (currently a stack overflow exception is maybe possible in KI)
- current background works only for the world.map file (Conditional backgrounds needed).
- KI ist completly random (could be improved...) see GameKi class
- Not all design elements are designed by the GameDesign class. Move design elements form DrawingBoard to design scope
- Movement drawing is not perfectly alignend.
- Movement drawing line could be shorter
- Some nice little you have won the game message for the end could be implemented.
